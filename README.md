Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is a powerful tool to investigate the size of molecules ...

In single-molecule FRET confocal microscopy, we monitor conformational changes of biomolecules by the intensity ratio of donor and acceptor fluorescence.
FRET is a powerful and widely spread tool, which allows the observation of intra-molecular distance changes in the range of 2 to 10 nanometer with high time resolution. 
However, non-ideal labeling stoichiometries (i.e. significant fraction of donor only and acceptor only labeled molecules) together with fluorescence bleaching and 
multiple molecule events make it often difficult to interpret and extract the information of interest (FRET efficiency and population fractions).

In the following script 'burstSim2.py' I provide a simulation software to generate non-ideal single-molecule photon trajectories, which include differences in detection 
efficiency and quantum yield, photo-bleaching, multiple molecule events and donor/acceptor only fractions helping to explore and understand measured data.

You can find the parameter section commented in the main file 'burstSim2.py'. 

Have fun!
